# Power BI
I can't think of other things to add at this point other than licensing

Tools: 
- Power BI Desktop 
    - Create PBIX Datasets and Reports
- Power BI Report Builder (Create Paginated RDL files)
    - This is the OLD SSRS report builder/VS tool with some lipstick and rebranding
    - Used for print quality reports like invoices
- Power BI Service
    - https://app.powerbi.com
    - This is where you publish and share content

## Licensing
I am going to assume you are a user of Azure and have a Tenant with some level of licensing

Your options are:
- Free
- Pro
- Premium

### Free User
You can download and use any of the reporting tools
