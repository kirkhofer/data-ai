    "- The Assistants API has Assistants (Agents), Tools, Threads and Messages\n",
    "- The OpenAI Assistants API has been in Preview for quite awhile with no plan to GA anytime soon\n",

    "\n",
    "# How will Azure AI Agent Service Work\n",
    "- This service will provide a robust set of AI searvies all within an Agent\n",
    "- With a drop in option for current users of the OpenAI Assistants API, this will be a enterprise ready solution that will go GA\n",
