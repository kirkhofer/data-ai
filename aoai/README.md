# Getting Started with Azure OpenAI
1. Request to get Azure OpenAI enabled on your subscription
    - [Request Access Link](https://aka.ms/oai/access)
    - You will need your subscription id(s)
1. Create an `Azure OpenAI` resource in your subscription
    > NOTE: Certain models are only available in certain regions/locations [ðŸ’¡Model Availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#model-summary-table-and-region-availability)
1. Start to use the Azure OpenAI Studio [here](https://oai.azure.com/)
1. Play around
    - Get started with Completion or Chat (most popular) options
    - Use the APIs to call with REST, Python or whatever flavor you like [ChatGPT Quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/chatgpt-quickstart?tabs=command-line&pivots=programming-language-studio)
        - All you need is an endpoint (like https://{your-resource-name}.openai.azure.com/) and a key (alpha numeric)
    - [OpenAI Samples (GitHub)](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook)
    - [OpenAI Examples](https://platform.openai.com/examples)
    - [Training: Explore Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-azure-openai)
1. Need GPT4? It is included but limited in capacity
1. Understand Quotas and how to get around them
    - [Quota](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/quotas-limits)
    - FYI: Look at the helper in here and retry logic. You man consider a load balancer and other options in front of the endpoints

## References
- [Chat on your data using Cognitive Search](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo/)
    - This is the most requested feature
    - Do this first with prompt engineering before fine tuning
- [Prompt Engineering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/advanced-prompt-engineering?pivots=programming-language-chat-completions)
    - This is so important!
    - System message
    - Treat the models like they are children. "Do this, don't do this"
    - Embed your "content" in the `system` prompt and then ask questions about it
    - Maintain history for chat
    - Use `tokenizer` to limit your prompt sizes
    - Userstand the difference between `prompt` and `completion`

## Azure OpenAI Subscription
Several assumptions on this part here:
1. Azure OpenAI subscription
    - Request here: https://aka.ms/oai/access 
1. Your deployment names are like the following
    - `gpt-35-turbo`
    - `code-davinci-002`
        > Yes I know this is going away and will update to ONLY use gpt going forward
    - `text-davinci-003`
1. Optional: Search Service
    - With Semantic search enabled
1. Optional: [Bing Search](#bing-it)
1. Optional: [SQL Database either local or in Azure](#nlp-with-azure-sql-using-openai)
1. `.env` config needed for python and PowerShell
    ```text
    AOAI_NAME={Name of the resource in azure}
    AOAI_KEY={Key of the OpenAI resource}
    AOAI_ENDPOINT=https://{Name of the resource in azure}.openai.azure.com/

    AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE={Cognitive Search Service name}
    AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX={Name of the index with the content}
    AZURE_SEARCH_KEY={API Key needed for search}

    BING_KEY={Bing search key}
    BING_ENDPOINT=https://api.bing.microsoft.com/

    SQL_DB_NAME=AdventureWorksDW
    SQL_SERVER=127.0.0.1
    SQL_USER=sa
    SQL_PASSWORD={whatever your password is}
    ```
1. `.streamlit\secrets.toml` needed for streamlit

# Load Balance with Azure OpenAI and 429 RateLimit
- [Learn streaming with the endpoints](https://github.com/avrabyt/OpenAI-Streamlit-YouTube/blob/451de7a5b9b2cfcd55ff828e0ddb213f2274cf8e/Stream-Argument/app.py)
- At minimum create the environment variables
    - Set the `OPENAI_API_BASE` and the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables at minimum
- OR: Create a `json.env` file with the content like below
    ```json
    [
        {"endpoint":"https://openairesource1.openai.azure.com/","key":"999aaa9999"},
        {"endpoint":"https://openairesource2.openai.azure.com/","key":"999aaa9999"}
    ]
    ```
- Launch `chat.py` with streamlit `streamlit run chat.py`
- Retry over and over against an interface and it will automatically load balance to another endpoint

This error shows two tries and it switches from one endpoint to another without the user even knowing
![See the image here](img/balancer-429.png)

# Load Tester
- Load tester for Azure OpenAI written in PowerShell
- Create a `json.env` file with the content like below
    ```json
    [
        {"endpoint":"https://openairesource1.openai.azure.com/","key":"999aaa9999"},
        {"endpoint":"https://openairesource2.openai.azure.com/","key":"999aaa9999"}
    ]
    ```
- Hammers in multi-threaded mode
- Run it `. '/load-tester.ps1' -MaxThreads 10 -MaxItems 10`
    - See the responses on the outputs with summaries and what actually happened
- Want more? Dig into the `$sync.(1).Results` and other attributes

# PowerShell with REST API
This is a big [script](aoai.ps1) of goodness. Run it (F5) and then just run the same sections later in the script after the `return`

Must have:
- Permissions to run scripts
    - `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`
- Optional: PowerShell SQL Server module
    ```powershell
    $mod = (Get-Module SqlServer -ListAvailable)
    
    if( $mod -eq $null -or $mod.Version.Major -lt 21 )
    {
        Install-Module SqlServer -AllowClobber
    }
    Import-Module SQLServer
    ```

Samples include:
- Completion (Code and Text via Davinci and ChatML)
- Chat Completion using GPT Turbo
- Hit a SQL database and use the Schema and Tables to have it return a query for you
- Hit the Bing service and create a "smart" search like the chat in Bing
- Uses the search index from this awesome solution for [Azure Search OpenAI Demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo)

# Azure OpenAI Python Notebook
Several [examples](aoai.ipynb) that run through a more python world of code

# NLP with Azure SQL using OpenAI
[This](azsqlnlp.py) solution is in Python and requires several things to get up and running on WSL/Ubuntu:
- Install the SQL driver for Linux
- Install the requirments: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Create a config file here `.streamlit\secrets.toml`
    - Replace anything in here with your own information
        ```text
        [aoai]
        key="{Azure key from the service}"
        base="https://{Azure Resource name}.openai.azure.com/"
        previewversion="2023-03-15-preview"
        version="2022-12-01"

        [sql]
        db="AdventureWorksDW"
        server="127.0.0.1"
        user="sa"
        pwd="{whatever this is}"
        driver="ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server"

        ```
- Launch the application: `streamlit run azsqlnlp.py`
## Example
Example using the query: `How many sales for 2013?` against the AdventureWorksDW
> Notice the differences between the models

Completion result:

# Bing It
[This](bingit.py) solution using the Bing Search API to create a "smart" search like the chat in Bing and the Azure Search OpenAI to summarize and return results

Uses Streamlit, Bing Search and Azure OpenAI

Add the following to the `.streamlit\secrets.toml` file
```text
[bing]
key="{Bing key}"
endpoint="https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0/search"
```

## Example: Specific Search
Enter in a website like `learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure` (NOTE: You can only go two levels deep)

Search for something and see results only for that specific area on the internet

# Caption Cam
[This](caption-cam.py) solution bring together a photo and Computer Vision 4.0 to turn a picture (from your web cam) into a text description

> NOTE: This requires a Cognitive Services resource

<img src="img/caption-cam.png" alt="Sample Caption Cam" width="512"/>

Add the following to the `.streamlit\secrets.toml` file
```text
[vision]
key="{Cog Services key}"
endpoint="https://{resource}.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
```

**Bonus: DALL-E**
If you really want to see this and have it enabled on your Azure OpenAI subscription, select "Yes".

> NOTE: Faces are very odd

# Chat Bot
[This](chatbot.py) is a simple chatbot using the new features in Streamlit to look more like an actual chat. This sample gives you a config for the System message as well as where your sources are. You can then get a list of deployments and select the one you want to use to chat with.
