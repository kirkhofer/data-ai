    "Launch monitors can measure a variety of parameters, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ball Speed: The speed of the golf ball immediately after impact.\n",
    "- Launch Angle: The angle at which the ball leaves the clubface relative to the ground.\n",
    "- Spin Rate: The rate at which the ball spins around its axis.\n",
    "- Carry Distance: The distance the ball travels through the air before hitting the ground.\n",
    "- Total Distance: The total distance the ball travels, including roll.\n",
    "- Club Speed: The speed of the clubhead at impact.\n",
    "- Smash Factor: The ratio of ball speed to club speed, indicating the efficiency of the impact."
